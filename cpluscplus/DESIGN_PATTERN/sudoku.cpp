Solving a sudoku puzzle can be rather tricky, but the rules of the game are quite simple.
A sudoku puzzle is a grid of nine by nine squares or cells, that has been subdivided into nine subgrids or "regions" of three by three cells. 
The objective of sudoku is to enter a digit from 1 through 9 in each cell, in such a way that:

Each horizontal row (shown in pink) contains each digit exactly once
Each vertical column (shown in yellow) contains each digit exactly once
Each subgrid or region (shown in green) contains each digit exactly once
